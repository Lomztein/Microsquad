# Microsquad

Project Microsquad is a very, *very* WIP project which may or may not simply end up overengineered to death. The general idea is a semi-realtime tactics game, where one controls a small squad of soldiers. One is then able to pause time at any point, and plan out commands to be carried out by the squad. These commands could vary from something basic such as moving around and attacking, to something fancy like getting the entire squad to suppress all by one enemy, and waiting for him to pop his head up from behind cover, only to be brutally shot in the facehole by a high-caliber sniper rifle.

Aside from being horribly broken, the current "game" has the following key features:
 * An unfinished and non-functional equipment system.
 * A fully functional inventory system.
 * Basic character commanding.
 * A stupidly overcomplicated weapons system, compared to the remainder of the game.

The current idea of "gameplay" is of a two-layer map with different factions all fighting for whatever reason. Ones goal is to use the micromanagement options that super cool timepowers gives you to achieve neat loot, in order to overpower or outsmart your enemies. The details haven't been planned out yet, sinec the game is barely functional.
